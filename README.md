# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups to better understand their purchasing behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Overview

Customer segmentation is a common technique used by businesses to divide customers into groups based on similarities such as purchasing behavior, demographics, or preferences. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for segmentation tasks.

This project applies the K-means clustering algorithm to customer data, grouping customers into clusters based on their purchase patterns. By identifying distinct customer segments, retailers can personalize marketing campaigns, optimize product offerings, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for customer segmentation contains information about customers' purchase history, including features such as:

- Total amount spent
- Number of purchases
- Types of products purchased
- Frequency of purchases

You can use a sample dataset provided with this repository or prepare your own dataset in a similar format.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running and viewing the notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

``

2. Navigate to the project directory:

``

3. Prepare or load the customer dataset and preprocess it as necessary.

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook `customer_segmentation.ipynb` to train the K-means clustering model and analyze the results.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform customer segmentation and interpret the clusters.

## Results

After applying K-means clustering to the customer data, you can expect to see results such as:

- Visualization of customer clusters
- Characteristics of each customer segment
- Insights into purchasing behavior and preferences of different customer groups
